## ðŸ’¡ Integration Examples

### Example 1: Email Service Integration

```typescript
// Email service subscribes to enrollment events
class EmailServiceEventHandler implements IEventHandler {
  async handle(event: IEvent): Promise<void> {
    switch (event.type) {
      case EnrollmentEventTypes.ENROLLMENT_CREATED:
        await this.sendEnrollmentConfirmation(event.payload);
        break;
      
      case EnrollmentEventTypes.COURSE_COMPLETED:
        await this.sendCongratulations(event.payload);
        break;
      
      case CertificateEventTypes.CERTIFICATE_ISSUED:
        await this.sendCertificate(event.payload);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Analytics Service Integration

```typescript
// Analytics service tracks all events
class AnalyticsEventHandler implements IEventHandler {
  async handle(event: IEvent): Promise<void> {
    await this.trackEvent({
      eventType: event.type,
      eventId: event.id,
      timestamp: event.timestamp,
      payload: event.payload,
    });
    
    // Update dashboards
    await this.updateMetrics(event);
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Notification Service Integration

```typescript
// Notification service for in-app notifications
class NotificationEventHandler implements IEventHandler {
  async handle(event: IEvent): Promise<void> {
    if (event.type.startsWith('notification.')) {
      const payload = event.payload as INotificationPayload;
      
      await this.createNotification({
        userId: payload.userId,
        type: payload.type,
        title: payload.title,
        message: payload.message,
        actionUrl: payload.actionUrl,
      });
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Event Payload Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Entity Creation

```typescript
interface IEntityCreatedPayload {
  entityId: string;
  creatorId: string;
  entityData: { /* key fields */ },
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Pattern 2: Entity Updated

```typescript
interface IEntityUpdatedPayload {
  entityId: string;
  updatedBy: string;
  updatedFields: string[];  // ['title', 'description']
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Pattern 3: State Transition

```typescript
interface IEntityStateChangedPayload {
  entityId: string;
  fromState: string;
  toState: string;
  reason?: string;
  changedBy: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Pattern 4: User Action

```typescript
interface IUserActionPayload {
  userId: string;
  targetEntityId: string;
  actionType: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```
